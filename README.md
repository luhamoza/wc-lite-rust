# wc lite in Rust

This is my first time trying to write Rust. wc is Unix command line tool for word, line, character, and byte count. This program only implement byte count.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Change directory into src
``cd wc-lite-rust/src``
4. Compile the code using the Rust compiler
``rustc main.rs``
5. Run the program with the desired file and the -c option
``./ccwc -c test.txt``
